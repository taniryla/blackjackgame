#Black Jack 

This is a black jack game developed in vanilla Javascript with state management. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer, which can be done as follows:

    -Get 21 points with the first two cards (which wins you 1.5x bonus awards), without the dealer getting a black jack; 
    -Reach a higher card score than the dealer without exceeding 21;
    -Let the dealer bust when their hand exceeds 21.

This game is built on a standard 52-deck card that is randomly shuffled. Player options include: 

    -Hit: take an extra card from the dealer until you decide to stop;
    -Stand: refrain from taking any more cards and then the dealer will draw cards.

    -Dealer pays 3:2 for a player blackjack;
